FormFriend:

- FormFriend is a mobile-first, web-based app designed to help immigrant families navigate official forms with confidence. Whether enrolling kids in school, applying for healthcare, or handling immigration paperwork, FormFriend empowers users with clear translations, term explanations, and AI-assisted guidance—right from their phones.

Why Timeless Tech?:
- From ancient scrolls to modern PDFs, bureaucracy has always involved complex documents, confusing language, and the stress of getting it "just right." FormFriend addresses a timeless human need: making essential services accessible through clearer, simpler, and smarter forms.
In an age of rapid AI development, technology should act as a bridge—not a barrier. FormFriend embraces that principle to help people who need it most.

Problem Statement:
- For generations, families have struggled to navigate complex bureaucracies—from handwritten forms to digital PDFs—especially when faced with unfamiliar language, confusing terms, and unclear document requirements.
Today, immigrant families continue to face these same barriers when filling out official forms for school, healthcare, immigration, or taxes. Despite advances in technology, many still lack access to tools that translate, explain, and assist in real time—especially in their native language. As a result, vital services remain out of reach for those who need them most.
